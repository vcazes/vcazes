- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vcazes
 searched for a long time how to configure the blind module.
I found Adrien's answer and it works.


    First ensure you curtain is fully closed.
    Set the calibration to "start" and click Write. Now you are in Calibration mode.
    Above, click on the Exec button in the function Up / Open. In the calibration mode the 30 secondes duration is disable.
    Once your curtain is fully open click on the "Exec" button in the function "Stop"
    Click on the Exec button in the function Down / Close
    Once your curtain is fully closed click on the "Exec" button in the function "Stop"
    Set the calibration to "end" and click Write

Enjoy, your module is now calibrated because it knows how many times it is needed to open and close :-D

(sorry for my appromative english ...)
